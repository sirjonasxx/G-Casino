# G-Casino

Advanced G-Earth extension that lets you create a virtual room on top of an existing room, which will only be seen for people that have the G-Casino extension installed. At the time of writing, the extension allows up to 13 types of modifications to a room (such as: modified heightmap, furniture that need to be added, etc)

It saves these room modifications in a gift that is placed in the room, which is used to communicate with other G-Casino instances.
G-Casino uses a dedicated compression system to get as much information into a gift, without having to worry about bobba-filter. Multiple gifts can be stacked, but mostly, only 1 gift should be needed to setup a whole room.


One of the modifications is the possibility to "virtually" simulate Habbo's dice mechanics. This means we can go above the dice limit as well and create a virtual casino.

**DISCLAIMER: do not use this extension to gamble, use for nostalgic reasons only**

More updates on this project soon!
